          I am average, I am not talented but I am a very hard working person.
          Give me a chance and I will prove to you what I am capable of and
          that't why I am doing this course. So don't dare tell me that I can't
          do it.

          <p>
            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

            <p>
                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
                developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
                it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
                Hero.
